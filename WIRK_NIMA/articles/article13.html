                <h2>Protecting You and Your Family from Snakes</h2>
                <p>Snakes – and the risk of Snake Bites – are a real threat to people living in Kenya. Most snakes are extremely timid creatures and are only likely to attack if cornered or provoked as attack is, in most instances, simply a form of defense.</p>
                <p>The required treatment for a Snake Bite varies from species to species, and being able to identify the species of snake that has bitten someone is an important part of the procedure. You can learn more about some of Kenya’s more common snakes in our Pest Control lectures.</p>
                <p>Be aware of the dangers posed by snakes and take steps to avoid them:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>When walking around make plenty of noise to advertise your presence which will most likely cause the snake to move away.</li>
                <li>Wear strong boots or shoes and long trousers when walking in grassland.</li>
                <li>NEVER walk about barefoot – especially at night!</li>
                <li>Avoid long grass and stick to paths and tracks as much as possible.</li>
                <li>Use a long stick to ‘probe’ the ground ahead of you; be aware that snakes can ‘play dead’ so do not attempt to touch a snake that appears dead.</li>
                <li>Walk in single file through long grass or the bush.</li>
                <li>Climb onto large rocks or logs in the pathway and step off them onto clear ground; these are favorite haunts for snakes.</li>
                <li>Watch where you put your hands and NEVER put them down a hole.</li>
                <li>Do not attempt to catch, kill, or corner a snake.</li>
                <li>Use a mosquito net at night and tuck it in tightly.</li>
                <li>Never sleep on the ground unless you have a tent with an attached and built-in ground sheet.</li>
                <li>Always use a torch to light the ground ahead of you at night.</li>
                <li>If you see a snake, stand absolutely still and then slowly back away; remember that many snakes can strike up to half their length.</li>
                <li>When entering garages, sheds, storerooms, and other outbuildings, open the door, light the internal area, and visually check for snakes, remembering that you will, in all likelihood, be blocking their exit and that this is when they can attack in defense.</li>

                <h2>Minimize the Risks of Snakes Living in Your Garden</h2>
                <p>Before looking at ways to prevent snakes from getting into your house, you should ensure that your garden is not a haven for snakes to take up residence because they would then be much more likely to make their way into your house, garage, or any outbuildings you may have.</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Long Grass is a favored habitat of snakes, so keep yours well mown.</li>
                <li>Keep shrubs trimmed round their base and away from the house.</li>
                <li>Ensure that branches of trees do not overhang your house or seating areas in your garden.</li>
                <li>Stack your wood on a suitable platform – such as a pallet – off the ground.</li>
                <li>Regularly sweep up leaves and other garden debris.</li>
                <li>Fill gaps, cracks, and crevices in brick and stone walls.</li>
                <li>Wooden decking in seating areas should be solid, rather than slatted, to prevent snakes climbing through it.</li>
                <li>Be aware that play areas such as Wendy houses, Tree houses, sand pits, etc., are potential harborages for snakes.</li>
                <li>Compost heaps could potentially attract many different species of wildlife which, in turn, may become the prey of a snake.</li>
                <li>Ensure that your compost is made in a sealed and solid structure, preferably raised off the ground, and can be securely sealed against any wildlife but particularly rodents.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>‘PROOF’ YOUR HOUSE AGAINST SNAKES</h2>
                <p>How ‘snake proof’ is your house? Are you aware that a snake, particularly the thinner ones, can get into your home through a gap the size of a biro or pencil – as can a mouse! Also, remember that snakes can swim and climb so carefully inspect your house, garage, and all outbuildings.</p>
                <p>Nima East Africa Limited can survey your premises and advise you on proofing against entry by snakes – and rodents.</p>
                <p>What to look for when inspecting your property:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Do you have screens on your windows and doors? Are there gaps around the frame or holes in the actual screening?</li>
                <li>Do you have gaps under doors in & out of the house, garage doors, shed doors? If so, bristle or sealing strip can be an effective way to seal these.</li>
                <li>Are there holes, cracks, or crevices in the brick or plasterwork of your house?</li>
                <li>Are there any holes, cracks, and crevices between patio areas or pathways and your house?</li>
                <li>Drainage areas in patios are a perfect point of entry.</li>
                <li>Is the gauge size of any grates covering your drains small enough to stop snakes going down it?</li>
                <li>Make sure that there are no holes in your roof that snakes can get through - particularly if trees overhang your house.</li>
                <li>Ensure skirting boards do not have gaps under or behind them.</li>
                <li>Seal all holes where wiring, plumbing, or gas enters your home.</li>
                <li>Cover gutters and drain pipes with fine gauge mesh.</li>
                <li>If your home has wooden floorboards, ensure that access to the floor space beneath them is sealed and that gaps between the boards themselves are filled.</li>
                </ul>
