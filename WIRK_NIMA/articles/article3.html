                <h2>The basics</h2>
                <p>
                    Flies are associated with more than 100 pathogens. These pathogens cause diseases in humans and animals. 
                    Sanitation is critical to controlling these pests, but accurate identification is essential for successful 
                    fly control. Flies collect pathogens on their legs and mouths when they feed on waste, these pathogens 
                    are transferred to our foods and tables when they land on them. It is therefore essential that cleanliness 
                    is maintained at home in order to control houseflies.

                <h2>Prevention</h2>

                <ul>
                <li>Flies prefer warm temperatures and are most active from late spring to early autumn. In order to best repel flies during this time, limit access to your home as much as possible, keeping doors and windows closed.</li>
                <li>Keep garbage cans clean and covered at all times.</li>
