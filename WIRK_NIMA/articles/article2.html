                    <p>
                        Cockroaches are common in homes because they prefer warm environments close to food and water. 
                        They can cause allergies, and track a lot of bacteria and germs into our homes. They also trigger 
                        asthma attacks especially in children. Cockroach infestation can be very dangerous especially to children. 
                        Cockroaches are very common insects infesting several homes, restaurants, hotels, and learning institutions. 
                        Cockroaches are repulsive and objectionable to most people simply by their presence.
