                <h2>Mosquitoes, what you need to know</h2>
                <p>Mosquitoes need quick response and eradication because they are a nuisance and a health threat. It is therefore important to eradicate mosquito infestation around your premises and other living recreational areas such as hotels and restaurants.</p>
        <p>Mosquitoes normally lay their eggs in water and they do not need much water to produce their eggs, a small amount of water is enough to support mosquito breeding.</p>

                <b>For prevention</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>Maintain your swimming pool regularly to prevent mosquito breeding.</li>
                    <li>Wipe out your bathroom every week. Eggs could get stuck to the bottom and survive.</li>
                    <li>Remove any puddles of water around your home to reduce mosquito breeding sites.</li>
                    <li>Dispose or puncture unusable tires to prevent pools of water from forming inside them.</li>
                </ul>
                <b>For Adult Mosquitoes</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>Keep grass and shrubs trimmed short, this will possibly reduce places for flying mosquitoes to rest.</li>
                    <li>Make sure doors and windows are in working order, leaving them open makes it easy for mosquitoes to fly in.</li>
                    <li>Consider using pesticides for treatment. Make sure to select specific products for controlling mosquitoes or contact Nima East Africa Limited for inquiries.</li>

            <h1>IMPORTANT</h1>
            <p>We use residual insecticides spray to eradicate mosquitoes. Many species of adult mosquitoes are found resting during the day. To solve this, professionals will spray the bushes, grass, shaded areas and flowers around the premises. Our residual insecticide for mosquitoes control is safe and very effective protecting treated environment for at least 10 months.</p>
