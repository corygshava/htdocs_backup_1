                <h2>Termites Entry Point</h2>
                <p>Termites are mostly confused with ants; this confusion has cost property owners a lot because of their sizes. They can easily be mistaken for one another from a far, but if you look closely, you would notice that termites have a pale or white color, straight and beaded antennas.</p>

                <p>Termites normally thrive underground, they often enter premises below or at a ground level, making wood to ground contact. Like porch steps, door frames a common entry point, holes, and cracks in walls. Termites are used to traveling through to foundations and other wooden parts of the house. They build mud tubes from the soil up to keep their soft bodies from dehydration until they get into contact with wood.</p>

                <h2>Treatment</h2>

                <p>After inspection, trained experts will apply termite treatment options- which is chemical treatment that is applied to affected areas and the surrounding in order to keep the termites away. Our treatment normally comes in two varieties which are repellent and non-repellent methods. Treatment is also applied to the siding and sheet rock of the house in order to further prevent any termites from setting within the structure.</p>
        
                <p>We normally recommend immediate follow-ups on a weekly basis to make sure the infestation is purely eradicated. Generally there will be no visible signs that the home is infested. Infestations can go undetected for months, hidden behind walls, floor coverings and other obstructions. Termite feeding and damage can progress undetected in the wood that is exposed because the outer surface is usually left intact.</p>
        
                <p>Ants are a nuisance when they invade your householdâ€™s structures mostly wooden areas. They require general elimination. We recommend an earlier preparation is required in the house majorly in the kitchen areas mostly because the food dropping and the weak rotten wooden carvings.</p>
