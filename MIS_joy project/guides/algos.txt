some html algos (coz i felt too lazy to make them from scratch)

    dashboard algo
        consider{
            the main divs are supposed to have some space in between them,
            they are to have a box shadow for contrast,
            they are to all have the same class ("main"),
            they should fit 2 per line
        }
        write an html page with 4 main divs{
            in the first one give it a heading ("Patient") and make it have hyperlinks saying ("new patient","list patients","search for a patient","list visits") all leading to "patients.php?req=(link text)" apart from the last one which will lead to "visits.php",
            in the second one give it a heading ("Appointments") and make it have hyperlinks saying ("new appointment","today's appointment","list appointments","expired appointments","kept appointments","search appointments") all leading to "appointments.php?req=(link text)",
            in the third one give it a heading ("Inventory") and make it have hyperlinks saying ("View inventory","add item","Administer Item") all leading to inventory.php?req=(link text)",
            in the third one give it a heading ("Users") and make it have hyperlinks saying ("list users","add user") all leading to "users.php?req=(link text)",
        }
        dont forget to use an appropriate header and footer and give the page a modern application design look. also add a navigation menu where its links are the different pages mentioned with homepage being active link

    sample form
        consider{
            the page is supposed to have a color pallete similar to that of a hospital,
            the page is to have a stock background image of a hospital (add one if you can),
            the form container will be having a white border, rounded corners (around 25px) and transparent white background (the idea is to mimic the look of test tubes) and will be centered on a screen,
            use a button as the submit control, instead of an input,
            include a relevant header
        }
        write a html page for a simple form that will be used to enter data, the inputs should be of all possible types (except checkbox, radio and file) and the css should contain styles for these states (focus and hover)

php algos

    connection guy
        write a php code that handles a database connection. make it that it checks if the specified database exists and creates it if it doesnt

    system setup
        consider{
            all database connection is handled by a file at "actions/connect.php",
            the code will check for and make the tables one by one, not as a single operation
        }
        write a php code that checks if tables called users, patients, visits, appointments and inventory exist in a database.
        if they dont the code creates the tables with these fields
            users
                fields
                    userid  number primary key auto_increment,

                    facname text,
                    dateadded datetime
        as a special case if the users table doesnt exist, add the record ("admin","123") as the username and password respectively after creating it

    user login
        consider {
            all database connection is handled by a file at "actions/connect.php",
            the table users exists in a connected database and has the fields (username and userpassword),
            variables for (username,password) have been passed via POST,
            the code will inform the user if the username exists in the table and if the 
            password is correct at separate points in the code
        }

        write a php code that will verify if theres a record in either users that 
        has the entered username and password combination

        provided the username and password combination exists a cookie called currentusername is to be set as 
        the entered username and another cookie currentusertype is to be set as the value of usertype

    new user
        consider {
            all database connection is handled by a file at "actions/connect.php",
            the table users exists in a connected database and has the fields (username and userpassword),
            variables for (username,password) have been passed via POST
        }
        write a php code that will check if the entered username already exists in the users table.
            if it does the code should stop excecuting and tell the user that he should try a different username
            if it doesnt add the new record using the passed data and inform the user if the process was successful

    delete user
        consider {
            all database connection is handled by a file at "actions/connect.php",
            the table users exists in a connected database and has the field (userid),
            variables for (userid) have been passed via POST,
            the idea is to make sure theres at least 1 record remaining in the users table
        }
        write a php code that will check if the entered userid already exists in the users table.
            if it does the code should delete the record with the corresponding userid if there are more than 1 records in the table
            if it doesnt inform the user of an invalid userid

    new patient
        consider{
            all database connection is handled by a file at "actions/connect.php",

            variables for (thename, theidnumber,thecontact) have been passed via POST,
        }
        write a php code that checks if theres a record in the patients table with the given idnumber
            if there is inform the user that the idnumber already exists
            if there isnt add a record to the patients table in this format (thename, theidnumber, thecontact, (today's date and time),(today's date and time))
    
    list and search for patients

            the table patients exists in a connected database and has the fields (patientid, patientname, idnumber, registrationdate, lastvisit, patientContact),
            the table will be in this format '<table class="w3-table w3-border thetable">',
            the first row in this format '<tr class="primarybg2">',
            and all other rows are in this format '<tr class="w3-border-bottom w3-hover-dark-grey">'
            theres a get variable called 'filter' that can been passed which is to contain the wanted idnumber,
            the idea is to search for records which the idnumber field contains the words in the filter get variable if its present
        }
        write a php code that will check if the filter variable exists
            if it doesnt display all records in these fields (patientid,idnumber, patientname, patientContact, registrationdate, lastvisit).
            if it does display all records in these fields (patientid,idnumber, patientname, patientContact, registrationdate, lastvisit) where the idnumber contains the given filter variable

            a value for (thevisitserial, thepatientidnumber, thefacilityused) has been passed via POST
        }

        add a record in the visits table in this format (thevisitserial,thepatientidnumber,thefacilityused,(todays date and time),"pending clearance") provided all the required data has been passed
    
    list visits algo
        consider{

            a value for (thevisitdata) may have been passed via GET
        }
        write a php code that will check if the value for thevisitdata has been passed
            if it has
                list records where the visitserial is the passed thevisitdata and  if there are none list records where patientidnumber is thevisitdata and if theres still none inform the user
            otherwise just list all the records

            a value for (visitserial) may have been passed via POST
        }
        write a php code that will check if the visitserial has been passed
            if it has it updates the corresponding record in the visits table as follows ((today's date),"cleared") as values for (dateverified, visitstatus) and if the record isnt found the user is informed
            otherwise it just informs the user of an invalid request format
