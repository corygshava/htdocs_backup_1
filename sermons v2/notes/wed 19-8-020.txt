1st peter 1:8

Every sin we commit is against God first.
Christ will judge believers.
God will judge unbelievers.
There is nothing like small sin or big sin its a total lie.
There is no cure for unbelief.
Its all about GOD's love.
In your dealings with people don't letvit only be about material things.
Place the value you think God has placed on you or that person.
You have to forgive to be forgiven

What the hell is purgatory?
